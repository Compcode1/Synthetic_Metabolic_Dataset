Synthetic Metabolic Dataset Analysis
Introduction  

This project generates and analyzes a synthetic dataset of 10,000 adults, reflecting the age and BMI distribution of the US adult population. It employs algorithms to simulate health metrics, assessing the prevalence and risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and random are used for data analysis and visualization.

Key Components:

Dataset Generation: Creates a synthetic dataset mirroring age and BMI distribution of the US adult population.
Waist Circumference: Generates values based on BMI, age, and gender.
Fasting Blood Glucose: Uses age and BMI to simulate FBG levels.
Triglycerides and HDL Cholesterol: Generates values based on age, gender, and BMI.
High Blood Pressure: Assigns status based on age and BMI.
Metabolic Syndrome Identification: Classifies individuals based on established clinical criteria.
Data Visualization: Analyzes health metrics by BMI and age.
Comparative Analysis: Compares synthetic data with NHANES reference data.
Conclusion

The synthetic dataset aligns closely with the US adult population's metabolic syndrome prevalence (34.58%). Visualization and comparative analysis reveal critical health trends and highlight areas for refinement.

Key Findings:
Females with Waist Circumference ≥ 35 inches: 58.83%
Males with Waist Circumference ≥ 40 inches: 63.42%
Fasting Blood Glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL: 40.93%
Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL: 30.56%
Males with HDL < 40 mg/dL: 32.47%
Females with HDL < 50 mg/dL: 15.05%
High Blood Pressure: 42.41%
Applications:

Privacy Preservation: Protects individual privacy while analyzing trends.
Algorithm Testing: Develops, tests, and trains machine learning models.
Scenario Simulation: Predicts outcomes and optimizes public health strategies.
Education: Provides a risk-free environment for learning data analysis.
Benchmarking: Validates new analytical tools before real-world application.
